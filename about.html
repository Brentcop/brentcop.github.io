 			<h1>About Brent Coppinger</h1>
 			<p>I was born in Royal Oak and raised in Berkley.This is just the start of my coding, and I have far to go still. It all began when I was roughly 8 years old when I took apart the family computer. I was always a very curious little boy and it took ahold of my computer learning ability. I tried to write my first program when I was 16 with a friend and we ported over a tower defence game on xbox 360.</p>
